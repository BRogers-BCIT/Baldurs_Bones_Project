# Baldur's Bones Text Adventure Project

#### Author: Braden Rogers

## Mission Statement:

This project seeks to expand off of a previous text adventure I had made for a school project.
The aim of this project is to expand on the original game by adding new features and further developing old ones.
In addition, this project also aims to use JavaFX to implement a full soundtrack and GUI. 
The end goal is to have created a text adventure game in the style of older games like *The Secret of Monkey Island*.

## Game Premise: 

This is a fan game that takes place within the *Forgotten Realms* universe from the *Dungeons & Dragons* property. 
The game makes use of locations and characters from within this world to tell a short and lighthearted fantasy story.

The player will journey through the port city of Waterdeep
while playing a dice-based gambling game know as "Baldur's Bones".
By beating local residents in the game, the player will increase their reputation within the city.

The end goal of the game is to gain enough reputation
to be worthy of playing against a local celebrity who goes buy the name "Volo".

Volo is a famous adventurer who tends to reside in a local tavern.
The game finishes when the player beats the Volo in a final game of Baldur's Bones.
